# web-scraping-challenge
Assignment Task

This task is about web-scraping and data analysis. First, scrape titles and preview text from Mars news articles, then scrape and analyze Mars weather data in a table.

Instructions

1.	Firstly, I was stuck for a long time while writing code related to the Martian days, until I found there were some duplicated data, finally solved the problem using the knowledge I learned in class.

2.	Secondly, I tried many times, but the graph of “oldest and hottest months in Curiosity's location by sorting the previous graph”. When I sorted data and use pandas to make the bar chart. The graph still did not show the xticks following the original order. I tried different methods but still couldn't solve the problem. I had to ask the BCS and I learned that normal pandas did not make graphs according to the sorted values, I had to do it manually or use a method like” sorted_temp.plot(kind='bar', color='skyblue')” to solve the problem.


Declaration

During the project, I used some syntax, formulas, and functions. Some of them are from class, and some of them are from a web search. When I made an error or had no idea what was going on, I chatted with ChatGPT and got some suggestions or debug for coding. I figured the problem out first and understood it, and then typed the code down. From this view, my work might have some similarities with others.
